# FOR FPGA IMPLEMENTATION
There is a quartus project in singlecycle_quartus folder implements the processor in Altera DE2-115 board which performs a simple stopwatch with 2 buttons: one runs the stopwatch and one stops the stopwatch, the time is displayed on common anode 7-segment LED on the board.


# FOR VERIFICATION
Navigate into 11_xcelium folder and run command
```bash
make
```

The result should like this
